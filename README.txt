This program contacts twitch, obs, and streamlabs servers.

It adds names to a list for those who:
-Are added manually
-Donate via streamlabs
-Donate bits via twitch
-Subscribe via twitch

Each user gains a specific number of points, and can earn more by performing actions such as donating.

Using these points, users can use twitch chat to send commands to turn on and off ‘filters’ or special sources to display something on OBS that twitch viewers will see.
